# Recorder Setup for Android Devices

## Getting Started
1. Download the recorder from **app.moquality.com > Apps > Download Test Recorder**

2. Select a device you would like to test with and **turn on USB Debugging**, which can be found inside of **Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging** and connect your device to your computer. **Press 'Always Allow"** on the popup on the device.

3. Make sure to have **uploaded a version of your app to test onto www.app.moquality.com** and have filled out the package name and activity name.

4. Launch the recorder with your connected device and **log in with either your API key or username and password**. Select your device and app from the drop down, as well as your screen size and keyboard preference.

5. **Press Record to begin** recording your test on your device. Interact with the screen projection you see in front of you. You **MUST use the bottom interface buttons** for actions instead of the hardware buttons on your device. 

6. When you are done recording a test, **press SAVE and name your test**. You can then view the test in the app.moquality.com website.

7. To **confirm the test was valid, move to the Tests Tab and try to run the test**. If you are unable to run the test, you may have to re-record it, or head down to the FAQ to see possible solutions. 


## FAQ

**Why does my phone not connect?**

Double-check that USB debugging is on and that you have clicked 'Allow' on the on-screen popup. You may have to unplug and replug the device in some cases.

**Why does it say I need to re-record in 'Stable Mode'?**

For some apps and tests, the regular mode may be unable to capture all the necessary details to successfully run the test. You can toggle 'Stable Mode' inside the recording by going into 'Settings' and toggling the option.
