# Setup an Android Device

## Enable USB Debugging

1. Select a device you would like to test with and then **turn on USB Debugging**, which can be found inside of **Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging** and connect your device to your computer. **Press 'Always Allow"** on the popup on the device.

## Upload App (Optional)

1. You can upload specific version of your app that you wish to test on [app.moquality.com](https://app.moquality.com). We automatically will find the `package name` and `activity name` for the app. You can verify it under the Settings tab.
