## Recording

When you press record, you app's cache will automatically cleared, and your app launched. You can turn auto-launch off in Settings. While in record mode, all interactions on the phone projection will be recorded. If you accidently misclick an item, or an action wasn't intentional, you can delete the action from the actionlist to the right. Be warned! If you delete an action that progressed the app or changed screens, deleting the action will prevent the ability to accurately replay this test!
