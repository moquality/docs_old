## Recording

When you press record, you app's cache will automatically cleared, and your app launched. You can turn auto-launch off in Settings. While in record mode, all interactions on the phone projection will be recorded. If you accidentally misclick an item, or an action wasn't intentional, you can delete the action from the action list to the right. Be warned! If you delete an action that progressed the app or changed screens, deleting the action will prevent the ability to accurately replay this test!

## Test Editing

To edit a previously recorded test, go into the Tests tab. Open up the test you would like to edit and hover over the specific step. Click the edit icon to drop down into the editor.  Here you can edit the step description, select a new widget to target, and add a sleep action to happen after the step runs. This can be helpful if your app is taking too long to process a specific screen, and the replay algorithm has already moved on.
