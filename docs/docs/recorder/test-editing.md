# Test Editing in Barista

## Introduction

Test editing feature allows you to change test steps, actions, test paramters, or sleep times.


## Opening the Edit Menu 

The *Edit Menu* can be accessed by hovering over the selected *Test Step*, and clicking the *Edit Button*.

## Editing Step Description

If you would like to change the description of a test step, it's as easy as replacing the content inside the *Description* tab and pressing *Submit*

## Editing Test Parameters (Coming Soon)

We are currently in the process of adding the functionality to parameterize test inputs, such as usernames and passwords, to expand the testing capabilities of an individual test.

## Adding Sleep Times after a step

*Sometimes* our AI will try to continue through a test, despite the device not being ready to receive the additional information. This can happen for several reasons, including changes in internet connection speed, or background apps hogging the phone's processing power. The simplest way to tell the app to wait, is to add a sleep action immediately following a problematic action.

## Selecting a New Target Widget (Beta)

If the recorded is unable to detect the desired widget, you can manually set a new target within the current screen. Simply go to *Select Target* tab and select the widget on the screen that you want to set as new target.
