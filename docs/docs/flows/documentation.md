# Documentation with MoQuality

You can use MoQuality to document manual or automated tests. The documentation feature allows you to export/download tests or test reports created on our platform. 

## Enable Docs

Enable the docs option in your [Accounts > Payment](https://app.moquality.com/account/payment) page. You need to put your credit card information to enable this feature. We will invoice you for this feature at the end of each month. Check out [pricing](https://www.moquality.com/pricing/) here.

## Export Tests

1. Create tests
Before you export tests you will first need to create tests with our Test Recorder. You can learn more about creating tests on MoQuality [here](/recorder). 

2. Create a test suite with the tests you want to export. Learn how to create test suite [here](/getting-started/test-suite).

3. To export tests click on the Download icon on the Test Suites page. We will email you a link to download the tests.
