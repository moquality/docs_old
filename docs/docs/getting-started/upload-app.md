3. Choose the type of app you would like to add, enter a name and, optionally, a description, and click submit. If you are adding an Android app, choose an APK to upload. If you are adding an iOS app, choose either a `.ipa` file or a `.app` directory in a Zip file. If the iOS app in question is a simulator build, make sure to check the "Is Simulator" checkbox, or the app will not work correctly.

## Now what?

After uploading an app, a user can either

* [Record tests](getting-started/recorder-link) using the MoQuality Test Recorder and [schedule runs](getting-started/scheduling-tests) of recorded tests to run on multiple devices.
* Request an [auto-generation of tests](getting-started/auto-test).
