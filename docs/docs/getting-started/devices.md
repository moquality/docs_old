In order to create a custom device group **click the "+ button"**. Custom device groups are important in many situations. For example, a user may want to run the apps on devices that have the latest android version, or to confirm it works on old versions. You can create a group of devices from a certain manufacturer, or create a device group composed of popular devices. See below for an example on how to make a custom group.
