If a user has not requested any tests, then there is no reporting.
Under *** Test Reports *** section,  each row represents a Test Report,  status, suites it ran on, device groups, and the various actions. The status is either a green tick signalling that no bugs found, red balloon showing that there are bugs, orange balloon indicating warnings or potential risks or an hour glass indicating that the tests yet to be executed. There are currently two results available now:

## View Report

 It shows the test runs of all the tests in the report across all the selected devices. The report provides the details af tests as well such as if the test was successful along with any bugs. By clicking the view report button you get the details of the test runs.

## View map

 It present a snapshot of the whole app itself. It shows how all the screens are connected with each other and therefore is useful in understanding the whole app structure. It aids in coming up with good test cases. For example,
 if a certain screen is not present in the map, then a user might be interested in creating a test case containing that screen. Such test case can easily be created with MoQuality Recorder with a few clicks.
