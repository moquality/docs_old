### Test Suites  

A **test** is a *series of actions* that should be performed to cover a use case or check an assertion. All of our tests start after clearing the cached data related to the app.

A **test suite** is a *series of tests* that should be run in an order. A test report is a test of these test suites. A test is created using the MoQuality Recorder. After creating a few tests, you can create test suites. 

*** Use case ***

A music app may have several tests related to playlists, therefore a playlist test suite would contain all the test cases related to playlist. Likewise a test suite would contain  tests for a music player.

*** Creating a suite ***

Navigate to the **Suites** tab and click on the Create Test Suite.

Now name the Test Suite and select the tests that are part of it. You can create multiple test suites this way.
