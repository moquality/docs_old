# Test Suites  

A **test suite** is an *ordered sequence of tests*. After recording the test cases through the recorder, you can create a Test Suite and schedule it to run on a *devie group*. 

## Test Suite Example

A music app may have several tests related to playlists, therefore a playlist test suite would contain all the test cases related to playlist. Likewise a test suite would contain tests for a music player.

## Creating a test suite

Navigate to the **Suites** tab and click on the Create Test Suite.

Now name the Test Suite and select the tests that you want to run. You can create multiple test suites this way.
