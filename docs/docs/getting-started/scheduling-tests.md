# Scheduling Tests

You will be able to schedule test runs on devices, after you have created tests using MoQuality Recorder, created Test Suites and device groups. 

*** Note: ***
The test cases you create adapt to every version of the app you upload. So the test, test suites, and device groups you create show up for every new version. Only the overview page keeps changing because the test report runs on a particular version.

## Executing Tests 

Click Overview tab and scroll down to Test Reports section.

Click on Run Tests, then the following window would pop-up. Enter the name of the report, 
select a device group, and select tests/suites you want to run on other devices.
