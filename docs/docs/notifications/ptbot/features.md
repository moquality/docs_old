# PTBot Features

## Upload App Reminder

When a story is in the `Delivered` state, that is, when the story is ready to be accepted or rejected, PTBot will post to the story a comment, reminding you to upload the new version of your app to MoQuality.

## Status Updates

If PTBot has been [configured correctly](getting-started.md#setup), it will post updates from tests to the comments of a story.
