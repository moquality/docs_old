# Getting Started with Gitbot

## Introduction

MoQuality's services provide an invaluable advancement to QA testing, but those advancements are only as powerful as their accessibility. It's difficult to practice continuous integration when you have to manually start a test after, for example, deploying a new version of your product to a staging environment. MoQuality understands this and has created a GitHub app to automatically test your **NEWLY DEPLOYED, PUSHED, MERGED, PULL REQUEST?** app. Follow the steps below to integrate MoQuality's GitHub app into your development workflow.

## Prerequisites

* GitHub accounts & respository: In order to use Gitbot, you will, of course, need to have created a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and a [repository](https://github.com/new).
* MoQuality account: Gitbot will need to link your GitHub account to your MoQuality account, which you can create [here](https://app.moquality.com/signup).
* MoQuality team: **NEED THIS!**
* MoQuality app: For the purpose of automatically testing new versions of an app, ensure that you have already uploaded the first version of your app through the [MoQuality website](https://app.moquality.com/).
