# Gitbot Features

As of late July, 2018, Gitbot can only post a comment with a link to the MoQuality apps page when a Pull Request is opened. In the future, however, Gitbot will be smarter and capable of automatically testing your new app versions when they are, perhaps, in a pending pull request. Then, Gitbot could post testing updates to the comments of said pull request, thereby notifying you of any breaking bugs.
