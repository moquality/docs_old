# Gitbot Features

## Upload App Reminder

When a pull request is opened or reopned, Gitbot will post to the pull request a comment, reminding you to upload the new version of your app to MoQuality.

## Status Updates

If Gitbot has been [configured correctly](getting-started/#setup), it will post updates from tests to the comments of a pull request.

## Future Features

In the future, Gitbot could be smarter and capable of automatically testing your new app versions when they are, perhaps, in a pending pull request. Then, Gitbot could post testing updates to the comments of said pull request, thereby notifying you of any breaking bugs without you having to manually enter any pull request URLs.
